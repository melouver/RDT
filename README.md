[sine-x](https://github.com/ZhangZhenghao) had finished this lab which implemented bi-directional data transfer.But I'd rather 
implement only unidirectional data transfer so I studied his code and remove some to complete this lab.
**Special thanks** to his implementation of multitimer and buffer on sender-side , that's really neat and sophiscated.
